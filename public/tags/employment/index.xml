      <description>Beginning An Exploration of Burlington County, NJ Early last year, my family and I moved back to the Philadelphia area. We settled in Burlington County, New Jersey. Details on the county and a bit about its history can be found on via Wikipedia.
I wanted to start this exploration with looking at county employment. I downloaded these data from the BLS QCEW website, which covers 2007 through 2017. Employment figures for the county for 2018 are not yet available.</description>
