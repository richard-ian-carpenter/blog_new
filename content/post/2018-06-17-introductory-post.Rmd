After a bit of research and testing, I have decided to start using the `blogdown` package in **R** in order to continue blogging.  With that change also comes the need to migrate my old blog from Google's Blogger -- that will be done over the summer and will probably a little bit of time since it's not a straight forward process.

I have updated the `About` page on this blog, as well as links that refer to my information.

I will be posting more shortly.  For the time being, I am getting things organized.

Stay tuned!
