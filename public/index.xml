      <description>I enjoy listening to/reading the stories on the various business news outlets about cryptocurrencies – I have been casually reading about blockchain technology and its different applications, but that is not the focus of this post.
While I am not an “expert” on cryptocurrencies, I have come to the opinion that they are not really currencies. I see them as a commodity as opposed to a currency. Why?
Like some other commodities, it is “mined”.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation to my first post just to see how things look using blogdown.
So… first, I’ll call one of the built in data sets:
library(tidyverse) library(hexSticker) data(cars) summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.00 Now that the summary statistics are out of the way, here’s a quick plot using the ggplot2 package, part of the tidyverse:</description>

      <description>After a bit of research and testing, I have decided to start using the blogdown package in R in order to continue blogging. With that change also comes the need to migrate my old blog from Google’s Blogger – that will be done over the summer and will probably a little bit of time since it’s not a straight forward process.
I have updated the About page on this blog, as well as links that refer to my information.</description>
