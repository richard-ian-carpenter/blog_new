<p>It is fun when insomnia, curiosity, and a good conversation lead to continuing research. Yesterday, I published a blog about the Dow Jones’ performance in 2018 <a href="https://www.justadatageek.com/2019/01/01/the-2018-dow-jones-industrial-average-s-performance/">link</a>. One of my graduate program professors, David Flynn – whom I will shamelessly plug the blog of here: <a href="http://barterisevil.com/">Barter Is Evil</a> – replied about the relative calm period during the summer in the graph that showed daily volumes.</p>

<p>I became curious if the spread between the daily high and low price had any correlation with the daily volume. So I calculated it quickly:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.6296172</code></pre>
<p>… and then created a graph to plot out the high-low spread to aid in the comparison:</p>

<p>David asked if I had looked at the high-low spread as a percentage of the opening price of the DJIA. So, I am going to do that quickly here. First, I calculate the percentage and then create a plot:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-02-djia-high-low-spread_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>… and then do the same with regard to the closing price:</p>

<p>All of this is leading to further research which appears to begin with the work of Richard Roll and his 1984 paper <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1984.tb03897.x">“A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid‐Ask Spread in an Efficient Market”</a>. So, on to some reading!</p>
