      <description>I enjoy listening to/reading the stories on the various business news outlets about cryptocurrencies – I have been casually reading about blockchain technology and its different applications, but that is not the focus of this post.
While I am not an “expert” on cryptocurrencies, I have come to the opinion that they are not really currencies. I see them as a commodity as opposed to a currency. Why?
Like some other commodities, it is “mined”.</description>
