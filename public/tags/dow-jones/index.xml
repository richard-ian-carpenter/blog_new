      <description>It is fun when insomnia, curiosity, and a good conversation lead to continuing research. Yesterday, I published a blog about the Dow Jones’ performance in 2018 link. One of my graduate program professors, David Flynn – whom I will shamelessly plug the blog of here: Barter Is Evil – replied about the relative calm period during the summer in the graph that showed daily volumes.
I became curious if the spread between the daily high and low price had any correlation with the daily volume.</description>

      <description>What better than to start off the New Year with a blog?

      <description>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gave us an interesting, if not a little scary, performance this month. When we look at the difference in closing prices, we can see that it was mostly within a range of +/-500 points:
Another view is the percent change in the DJIA, indexing on 1 October 2018 and seeing how it performed:
On a similar note, I also looked at the year-to-date performance of the DJIA and noticed that volatility in the closing price occurred in two periods: the one we are experiencing now in October and the other that occurred in the February to April time period.</description>
