# ... this is the percent change, with the first day set at zero:

It is fun when insomnia, curiosity, and a good conversation lead to continuing research.  Yesterday, I published a blog about the Dow Jones' performance in 2018 [[link]](https://www.justadatageek.com/2019/01/01/the-2018-dow-jones-industrial-average-s-performance/).  One of my graduate program professors, David Flynn -- whom I will shamelessly plug the blog of here: [Barter Is Evil](http://barterisevil.com/) -- replied about the relative calm period during the summer in the graph that showed daily volumes.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
p1
```

I became curious if the spread between the daily high and low price had any correlation with the daily volume.  So I calculated it quickly:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
cor(df$volume, df$high_low_spread)
```

... and then created a graph to plot out the high-low spread to aid in the comparison:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2)
```

David asked if I had looked at the high-low spread as a percentage of the opening price of the DJIA.  So, I am going to do that quickly here.  First, I calculate the percentage and then create a plot:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df$ratio_spread_to_open <- (df$high_low_spread/df$open)*100

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date, y = ratio_spread_to_open)) +
    geom_line() + theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Dow Jones Index, 2018",
         subtitle = "High-Low Spread to Opening Percentage",
         x = "Date", y = "Percent", 
         caption = "Source: Yahoo! Finance") +
    scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b")
```

... and then do the same with regard to the closing price:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df$ratio_spread_to_close <- (df$high_low_spread/df$close)*100

ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date, y = ratio_spread_to_close)) +
    geom_line() + theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Dow Jones Index, 2018",
         subtitle = "High-Low Spread to Closing Percentage",
         x = "Date", y = "Percent", 
         caption = "Source: Yahoo! Finance") +
    scale_x_date(date_labels = "%b")
```

All of this is leading to further research which appears to begin with the work of Richard Roll and his 1984 paper ["A Simple Implicit Measure of the Effective Bid‐Ask Spread in an Efficient Market"](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1984.tb03897.x).  So, on to some reading!
