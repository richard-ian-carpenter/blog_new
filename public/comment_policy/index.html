<h2>The Rules:</h2>
<div id="keep-it-civil-aka-dont-be-a-jerk" class="section level3">
<h3>Keep it civil (aka “Don’t be a jerk!”)</h3>
<p>We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.</p>
<p>So, remember to avoid:</p>
<pre><code>- name-calling
- ad hominem attacks
- responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
- knee-jerk contradiction
- comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don&#39;t say it. 
- treat others the way you’d like to be treated.</code></pre>
<p>Always strive to add value to every interaction and discussion in which you participate.</p>
<p>If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.</p>
</div>
<div id="keep-it-tidy" class="section level3">
<h3>Keep it tidy</h3>
<p>Help make my life easier by taking a moment to ensure that what you’re about to post is in the right place. That means:</p>
<pre><code>- don’t post off-topic comments or discussions
- don’t cross-post the same thing multiple times</code></pre>
<p>If you see something, say something: moderating comments can be difficult, but it’s something we can do together. So, if you see an issue, contact me if possible or flag any comments for review. If you believe someone has violated this site’s Comment Policy, report it to Disqus by flagging the user’s profile.</p>
<p>Some Additional Clarification(s):</p>
