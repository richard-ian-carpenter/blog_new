      <description>This is a continuation to my first post just to see how things look using blogdown.
So… first, I’ll call one of the built in data sets:
library(tidyverse) library(hexSticker) data(cars) summary(cars) ## speed dist ## Min. : 4.0 Min. : 2.00 ## 1st Qu.:12.0 1st Qu.: 26.00 ## Median :15.0 Median : 36.00 ## Mean :15.4 Mean : 42.98 ## 3rd Qu.:19.0 3rd Qu.: 56.00 ## Max. :25.0 Max. :120.</description>

      <description>After a bit of research and testing, I have decided to start using the blogdown package in R in order to continue blogging. With that change also comes the need to migrate my old blog from Google’s Blogger – that will be done over the summer and will probably a little bit of time since it’s not a straight forward process.
I have updated the About page on this blog, as well as links that refer to my information.</description>
