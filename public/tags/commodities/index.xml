      <description>It has been a while since I have posted anything on my blog. Life has been busy since I started a new job in mid-January. I accepted a position as a Risk Analyst with a company in the energy industry. I focus on the financial and economic risk faced by the company, including natural gas and electricity prices. The learning curve is steep, but I am enjoying it: I have reached Nerdvana!</description>

      <description>I enjoy listening to/reading the stories on the various business news outlets about cryptocurrencies – I have been casually reading about blockchain technology and its different applications, but that is not the focus of this post.
While I am not an “expert” on cryptocurrencies, I have come to the opinion that they are not really currencies. I see them as a commodity as opposed to a currency. Why?
Like some other commodities, it is “mined”.</description>
