<p>After a bit of research and testing, I have decided to start using the <code>blogdown</code> package in <strong>R</strong> in order to continue blogging. With that change also comes the need to migrate my old blog from Google’s Blogger – that will be done over the summer and will probably a little bit of time since it’s not a straight forward process.</p>
<p>I have updated the <code>About</code> page on this blog, as well as links that refer to my information.</p>
<p>I will be posting more shortly. For the time being, I am getting things organized.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
