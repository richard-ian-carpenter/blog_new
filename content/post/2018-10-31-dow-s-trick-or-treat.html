<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) gave us an interesting, if not a little scary, performance this month. When we look at the difference in closing prices, we can see that it was mostly within a range of +/-500 points:</p>

<p>Another view is the percent change in the DJIA, indexing on 1 October 2018 and seeing how it performed:</p>

<p>On a similar note, I also looked at the year-to-date performance of the DJIA and noticed that volatility in the closing price occured in two periods: the one we are experiencing now in October and the other that occured in the February to April time period. The May - September time period were relatively quiet in terms of the DJIA closing price:</p>

<p>Likewise, the performance appeared to be range bound of +/-5% when indexed to the first trading day of the year (2 January 2018):</p>

<p>Something to build on from here would be looking at the components of the DJIA and compare their individual performances over the same time period. I am working on creating a Shiny app since it is more dynamic than this blog. Once that is complete, I will include a link to it.</p>
<p>This is all I have for the moment. I hope you enjoyed the (brief) post.</p>
